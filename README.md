# MyMoviePlan

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.1.

NMS Cinemas is a chain of single screen theatres that screen movie shows of different genres and languages at very genuine prices. It was established in 2004 in Pune, India. Recently, the business analysts noticed a decline in sales since 2010. They found out that the online booking of movie tickets from apps, such as BookMyShow and Paytm were gaining more profit by eliminating middlemen from the equation. As a result, the team decided to hire a Full Stack developer to develop an online movie ticket booking web application with a rich and user-friendly interface.
You are hired as the Full Stack Java developer and are asked to develop the web application. The management team has provided you with the requirements and their business model so that you can easily arrange different components of the application.
